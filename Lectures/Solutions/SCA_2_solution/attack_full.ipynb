    "### Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "A 'trace' is a side-channel information left by a programmer to debug the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example a trace is a 10th round input state of the AES-128 algorithm, i.e., a State before the Sbox operation in the last round.\n",

    "### Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to find the Master key (round key 0) embedded into the binary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The master key is in the form of SCA{XXXXXXXXXXX}, where X is an ASCII printable symbol."
