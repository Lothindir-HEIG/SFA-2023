    "### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task you will analyse software T-table AES-128 implementation running on ESP32 (see the code_sample.txt in the support folder).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The software implementation does not contain any protection against side-channel attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "During one AES-128 execution a plaintext, a ciphertext and a real power trace of 5,000 samples were recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "10,000 encryptions were performed. Associated data (a plaintext, a ciphertext and a trace) was stored in HDF5 file.\n",
    "\n",
    "One oscilloscope snapshot shows an entire AES execution, however, only the part related to encryption process, i.e., a part shown from 50 us to 60 us on the oscilloscope snapshot, is available for the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The measurements were performed with LeCroy WaveRunner Zi625 and a differential probe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "A 'trace' is a side-channel information measured between the Vdd and the GND pins of the WROOM module (ESP32). \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, CPU is vulnerable either to Hamming weight or to Hamming distance data models. There might be more than one instruction leaking secret data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example a trace is a 5,000 bytes array of int8 (the amplitude of the measured voltage).\n",
    "\n",
    "This array contains various encryption information measured with noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "You might perform several subtasks, but the main objective is to get the Master Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The master key is in the form of SCA{XXXXXXXXXXX}, where X is an ASCII printable symbol."
